            <h1>Why Amaro Montenegro Is a Bartender's Best Friend?</h1>
            <small>author: A.V.</small>
            <p>Amaro, Italy's traditional, bittersweet herbal liqueur, is trending on the American spirits scene. You've probably tasted an amaro via some popular drinks in Dallas.

                The ubiquitous Aperol Spritz gets its flavor from a citrusy, low-alcohol amaro called Aperol. The beloved Negroni typically features Campari, a boldly bitter amaro used mostly for mixing. But under the big amaro umbrella, there are dozens of complex amari that are delicious sipped solo. Traditionally served as a digestif after a big meal, they're also great mixed with tonic water or soda for a refreshing, low-alcohol aperitif. Bartenders love amari for the bittersweet, herbaceous depth they lend cocktails, too.</p>        
            <h3>My Favourite Amaro</h3>

        <p>Amaro (which means bitter, in Italian) is a broad category of liqueurs infused with loads of botanicals. Many are made using centuries-old secret recipes. Bittering agents vary widely: Gentian roots, wormwood, cinchona bark, and grapefruit peel are common ones. Some famous amari originated in medieval monasteries, and a few are still produced by monks. Others were concocted by late 19th century pharmacists, who promoted amaro as a digestive aid (modern day advocates also say the herbal infusion settles the stomach). And many more amari have been developed since the 20th century.</p>
