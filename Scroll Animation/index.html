    <h1>How many types of beer do you know?</h1>
    <div class="box lager">
        <h2>Lager</h2>
        <p>Lagers are a newer style of beer with two key differences from ales. Lagers ferment for a long time at a low temperature, and they rely on bottom-fermenting yeasts, which sink to the bottom of the fermenting tank to do their magic.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box pilsner">
        <h2>Pilsner</h2>
        <p>A subspecies of lager, pilsner beers are distinguished by their water, which varies from neutral to hard. Pilsners are among the hoppiest lagers and generally have a dry, slightly bitter flavor. Their light golden color, clear body, and crisp finish make Pilsners a popular summer beer.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box amrerican_lager">
        <h2>American Lager</h2>
        <p>Characterized by its pale color which ranges from resembling straw to a golden hue. American lagers are highly carbonated beers with a refreshing, crisp taste. The flavor may vary from brand to brand but tend to lack the hops and malt that are present in ales. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="box ale">
        <h2>Ale</h2>
        <p>Ale is a general category of beer: You'll find sub-categories like brown ales or pale ales. This is the oldest style of beer, which dates back to antiquity. What distinguishes an ale - and also makes this category of beer accessible for home brewers - is a warm-temperature fermentation for a relatively short period of time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box porter">
        <h2>Porter</h2>
        <p>A type of ale, porter beers are known for their dark black color and roasted malt aroma and notes. Porters may be fruity or dry in flavor, which is determined by the variety of roasted malt used in the brewing process.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box stout">
        <h2>Stout</h2>
        <p>Like porters, stouts are dark, roasted ales. Stouts taste less sweet than porters and often feature a bitter coffee taste, which comes from unmalted roasted barley that is added to the wort. They are characterized by a thick, creamy head. Ireland's Guinness may be one of the world's best-known stouts.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box blonde_ale">
        <h2>Blonde Ale</h2>
        <p>This easy drinking ale is a summer favorite, thanks to its light malt sweetness and trace of hops, which add aroma. As the name suggests, blonde ales have a pale color and a clear body. They tend to be crisp and dry, with few traces of bitterness, rather than hop-heavy or dank.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box brown_ale">
        <h2>Brown Ales</h2>
        <p>Brown ales range in color from amber to brown, with chocolate, caramel, citrus, or nut notes. Brown ales are a bit of a mixed bag, since the different malts used and the country of origin can greatly affect the flavor and scent of this underrated beer style.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box pale_ale">
        <h2>Pale Ale</h2>
        <p>An English style of ale, pale ales and known for their copper color and fruity scent. Don't let the name fool you: these beers are strong enough to pair well with spicy foods.
        Related to the pale is the APA, or American Pale Ale, which is somewhat of a hybrid between the traditional English pale ale and the IPA style. American pale ales are hoppier and usually feature American two row malt. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="box india_pale_ale">
        <h2>India Pale Ale</h2>
    <p>Originally, India Pale Ale or IPA was a British pale ale brewed with extra hops. High levels of this bittering agent made the beer stable enough to survive the long boat trip to India without spoiling. The extra dose of hops gives IPA beers their bitter taste. Depending on the style of hops used, IPAs may have fruit-forward citrus flavors or taste of resin and pine.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box wheat">
        <h2>Wheat</h2>
    <p>An easy-drinking, light style of beer, wheat beers are known for a soft, smooth flavor and a hazy body. Wheat beers tend to taste like spices or citrus, with the hefeweizen or unfiltered wheat beer being one of the more common styles.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box sour_ale">
        <h2>Sour Ale</h2>
    <p>An ancient style of beer that's taken off in popularity in recent years, sour ales are crafted from wild yeasts, much like sourdough bread. These beers are known for a tart tang that pairs well with tropical fruit and spices.</p>
